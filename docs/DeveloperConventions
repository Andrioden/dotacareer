Javascript:
- Variable and scope variables names: variableName
- Method name: methodName
- Class name: ClassName
- Controllers should use comments to define sections of the code for variables, event listeners, exposed methods and private methods. Se player.controller.js for best practice.

Python:
- We almost strictly follow the very well known PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
- Exception is line length. Avoid putting shit on different lines that does not logically belong so
- Variable name: variable_name
- Method name: method_name
- Internal class method name with _underscore first
- Class name: ClassName
- Two newlines between classes and methods in the 0-indent of files.
- One newline between class methods.
